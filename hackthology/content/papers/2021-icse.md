#### Abstract

Statistical fault localization (SFL) techniques use execution profiles and
success/failure information from software executions, in conjunction with
statistical inference, to automatically score program elements based on how
likely they are to be faulty. SFL techniques typically employ one type of
profile data: either coverage data, predicate outcomes, or variable values. Most
SFL techniques actually measure correlation, not causation, between profile
values and success/failure, and so they are subject to confounding bias that
distorts the scores they produce. This paper presents a new SFL technique, named
UniVal, that uses causal inference techniques and machine learning to integrate
information about both predicate outcomes and variable values to more accurately
estimate the true failure-causing effect of program statements. UniVal was
empirically compared to several coverage-based, predicate-based, and value-based
SFL techniques on 800 program versions with real faults.
