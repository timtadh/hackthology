#### Abstract

We present a new algorithm, Score Weighted Random Walks (SWRW), for behavioral
fault localization. Behavioral fault localization localizes faults (bugs) in
programs to a group of interacting program elements such as basic blocks or
functions.  SWRW samples suspicious (or discriminative) subgraphs from
basic-block level dynamic control flow graphs collected during the execution of
passing and failing tests.  The suspiciousness of a subgraph may be measured by
any one of a family of new metrics adapted from probabilistic formulations of
existing coverage-based statistical fault localization metrics.  We conducted an
empirical evaluation of SWRW with nine subgraph-suspiciousness measures on five
real-world subject programs.  The results indicate that SWRW outperforms
previous fault localization techniques based on discriminative subgraph mining.


# Introduction

*Automated fault localization* techniques have been developed to help
programmers locate software faults (bugs) responsible for observed software
failures.  Many of these techniques are statistical in nature (e.g., {[Jones
2002](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/581339.581397), [Liblit
2005](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1064978.1065014), [Liu
2005](https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611972757.26)}).  They employ statistical
measures of the *association*, if any, between the occurrence of failures and
the execution of particular program elements like statements or conditional
branches.  The program elements that are most strongly associated with failures
are identified as "suspicious", so that developers can examine them to see if
they are faulty.  The association measures that are used are often called
*suspiciousness metrics* {[Jones
2004](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2004.1317420)}.  Such *statistical fault
localization* (SFL) techniques typically require *execution profiles* (or
*spectra*) and PASS/FAIL labels for a set of both passing and failing program
runs.  Each profile entry characterizes the execution of a
particular program element during a run.  For example, a statement-coverage
profile for a run indicates which statements were executed at least once.  The
profiles are collected with program instrumentation, while the labels are
typically supplied by software testers or end users.

*Coverage Based Statistical Fault Localization* (CBSFL) techniques compute a
suspiciousness score for each program element. The elements are presented to the
programmer as a ranked list with the most suspicious elements at the top
{[Liblit 2005](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1064978.1065014)}.  Programmers
utilize the list to guide their debugging effort by starting at the most
suspicious element and moving down. The effectiveness of a CBSFL suspiciousness
metric is judged by how accurately it ranks a bug's (or bugs) location in a
program. The higher in the list the bug's location appears the better the metric
performs {[Lucia 2014](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smr.1616)}.

Kochhar *et al.*  {[Kochhar 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2931037.2931051)}
recently surveyed 386 software engineering practitioners about their
expectations for automated fault localization. While practitioners indicated
their preference for very accurate algorithms, over 85% of respondents also
indicated their preference for tools which help them understand the output of
fault localization algorithms. This is an important finding as most statistical
approaches do not provide an explanation of their results. The SFL techniques
often simply compute suspiciousness measures and rank the program elements
accordingly.  These rankings may be helpful, but without more information
programmers could overlook the faulty element even when it is ranked highly.

*Suspicious-Behavior Based Fault Localization* (SBBFL) is a statistical fault
localization technique that aids the programmer in understanding suspiciousness
scores by providing a *context* of interacting elements.
<span style="color: gray">(*NB: Dynamic slicing {[Tip
1995](https://www.franktip.org/pubs/jpl1995.pdf)} also provides such a context, but does
not in itself involve suspiciousness measures*)</span> Instead of implicating a
single element, SBBFL implicates a larger runtime behavior (see process in
Figure 1). The implicated control flow paths (or subgraphs) may help the
programmer understand the nature of a bug {[Cheng
2009](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1572272.1572290)}.

We present a new algorithm, *Score-Weighted Random Walks* (SWRW), for
behavioral fault-localization.  SWRW belongs to a family of
*discriminative graph-mining algorithms*  that have previously been used
for behavioral fault localization

}. Graph mining is very powerful in principle but algorithms must
make trade-offs to address the challenging combinatorics of the graph mining
problem.  Our new algorithm, SWRW, mitigates the combinatorics by randomly
sampling "suspicious" subgraphs from dynamic control flow graphs.  During the
sampling process, the most suspicious subgraphs (as judged by a suitable
suspiciousness metric) are favored for selection. Unlike previous algorithms,
SWRW can be used with a wide variety of suspiciousness metrics --- which allows
it to use better metrics than available to previous work.  Even when using the
same metric as similar algorithms, SWRW localizes faults more accurately than
they do.

## Summary of Contributions

-  A new behavioral fault localization algorithm, SWRW, that samples suspicious
   subgraphs from dynamic control flow graphs.  Unlike similar algorithms, SWRW
   can be used with a variety of suspiciousness metrics.

-  New generalizations of existing suspiciousness metrics that allow them to be
   applied to behaviors represented by subgraphs of dynamic control flow graphs.

-  An empirical study whose results suggest that SWRW is more accurate than
   similar algorithms.

-  Dynagrok, a new instrumentation, mutation, and analysis tool for the Go
   programming language.




# Dynagrok: A New Profiling Tool
All *Coverage-Based Statistical Fault Localization* (CBSFL) techniques use
*coverage profiles* to gather information on how software behaved when
executed on a set of test inputs. A coverage profile typically contains an entry
for each program element of a given kind (e.g., statement, basic block, branch,
or function), which records whether (and possibly how many times) the element
was executed during the corresponding program run.  The profiles and PASS/FAIL
labels for all tests are then used to compute a statistical
*suspiciousness score* for each program element.

The process of gathering the coverage information from running programs is
called *profiling* and there are many different varieties of profilers and
profiling techniques available. Coverage profiling is a simple and widely
implemented technique, which is why it has been widely used by the fault
localization community. Another technique is *tracing*, which logs the sequence
of program locations as they are executed. The traces provide detailed
information on the behavior of the program but could grow to be very large for
long running programs. This paper uses *execution flow profiling* which
computes the dynamic interprocedural control flow graph of a program's
execution.  This provides some of the benefits of tracing without recording an
excessive amount of data.

To capture execution flow profiles we developed
[Dynagrok](https://github.com/timtadh/dynagrok), a new analysis, instrumentation
and mutation platform for the Go programming language. Go is a newer language
(2009) from Google that has been seeing increasing adoption in industry. It has
been adopted for web programming, systems programming, "DevOps," network
programing, and databases {<http://tiobe.com/tiobe-index/>,
<http://blog.golang.org/survey2017-results>}.  Dynagrok builds upon the
*abstract syntax tree* (AST) representation provided by the Go standard
library.

<p>
Dynagrok collects profiles by inserting instrumentation into the AST of the
subject program.  The profiles currently collected are <em>dynamic control flow
graphs</em> (DCFGs) whose vertices represent basic blocks. A <em>basic
block</em> is a sequence of program operations that can only be entered at the
start of the sequence and can only be exited after the last operation in the
sequence 
{<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/compilers-principles-techniques-and-tools/oclc/12285707">Aho 2007</a>}.
A basic-block level <em>control flow graph</em> (CFG) is a directed labeled
graph <span class="math">\(g = (V, E, l)\)</span> comprised of a finite set of
vertices <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, a set of edges <span class="math">\(E
\subseteq V \times V\)</span>, and a labeling function <span
class="math">\(l\)</span> mapping vertices and edges to labels.  Each vertex
<span class="math">\(v \in V\)</span> represents a basic block of the program.
Each edge <span class="math">\((u, v) \in E\)</span> represents a transition in
program execution from block <span class="math">\(u\)</span> to block <span
class="math">\(v\)</span>. The labeling function <span class="math">\(l\)</span>
labels the basic blocks with a unique identifier (e.g.
<code>function-name:block-id</code>), which is consistently applied across
multiple executions but is never repeated in the same execution.
</p>

Figure 2 shows an example DCFG collected by Dynagrok for a simple program that
computes terms of the Fibonacci sequence. To collect such graphs Dynagrok parses
the program into an AST using Go's standard library.  Dynagrok then uses a
custom control flow analysis to build static control flow graphs. Each basic
block holds pointers to the statements inside of the AST. The blocks also have a
pointer to the enclosing *lexical block* in the AST.  Using this information,
Dynagrok inserts profiling instructions into the AST at the beginning of each
basic block. The instructions inserted by Dynagrok use its `dgruntime` library
to track the control flow of each thread (which is called a *goroutine* in Go).
When the program shuts down (either normally or abnormally) the `dgruntime`
library merges the flow graphs from all the threads together and writes out the
result.

Each vertex is a basic block with a basic block identifer (e.g.
