<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Free Software movement which began in earnest twenty-five years ago
has become one of the most quietly influential movements of the Internet
age. Today, many social phenomenas occurring in our networked world,
such as Wikileaks, can be understood more completely by understanding
the Free Software movement. The Free Software movement can be usefully
analyzed from many perspectives however, this paper will use the lens of
religion. Specifically, the movement will be analyzed from the context
of selected writing from its founder, Richard M. Stallman, using the
categories defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade" title="Mircea Eliade">Mircea
Eliade</a>.
Through the use of Eliade's categories one understands Stallman to be
demarcating the sacred from the profane in an attempt to return to an
archaic past.</p>
<h3>Eliade's Terms and Categories</h3>
<p>In his 1957 treatise, The Sacred and the Profane , Mircea Eliade creates
categories, such as sacred vs profane, and attempts to fit many
different religious traditions into the categories. Methodologically
this approach has a serious shortcoming, the supporting traditions do
not always fit well into the chosen categories. However, since Eliade
has defined broadly useful, even if not universally applicable,
categories for interpreting religious traditions. The utilization of
these categories highlights the religious nature of the Free Software.</p>
<p>Eliade's primary purpose in his treatise is to discuss the experiential
demarcation between the sacred and the profane. Eliade defines the
sacred in two senses. The first is recursive: the sacred is the opposite
of the profane.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> In this sense one can place objects
into two categories, sacred and profane, as long as they don't overlap.
Eliade clarifies this slightly through use of Rudolf Otto's term, the
wholly other,<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> indicating the sacred manifests itself as
wholly different than the profane. By using Otto's language, Eliade
indicates the sacred has an element to the divine.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this paper we will stipulatively take the divine to
mean: that which seems to the individual to have a numinous quality. An
object which has a numinous quality is one which seems irreducible and
the individual thus feels a creature dependence
towards.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Thus, the sacred is the manifestation of the
numinous into the corporeal. The profane, on the other hand, is the
common, that which seems to be understandable. These stipulative
definitions conform to Eliade's requirements: the sacred is opposite of
the profane, and the sacred is wholly different than the profane.</p>
<p>In addition to his categories, sacred and profane, Eliade defines two
related categories: archaic society and modern society. The man who
lives in archaic society, homo religiosus, seeks to exist as much as
possible in or around the sacred.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> In contrast the man
of modern societies, modern man, exists in a desacralized
environment.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The modern man depending on his
temperament may look back to the religious man either romantically or
derisively. Thus, modern and archaic do not indicate, as they
traditionally do, an essential ordering or time line. It may be that
archaic and modern coexist with each look back to the other as a
mythical past while eagerly looking forward to a time when man is more
or less religious.</p>
<h3>The Free Software Movement</h3>
<p>What is the Free Software movement? How can it be understood as
religious, using the terms and categories defined by Eliade? The Free
Software movement was started in 1984 with the publication of the GNU
Manifesto by Richard M. Stallman. Stallman had become disgusted with the
unethical nature of software and computer usage and sought a return to
an earlier time where users freely shared and modified programs. To
enable this return, he set about to create an ecosystem of software
which was protected from being made proprietary. In many ways Stallman
succeeded: today there is large amount of Free Software available. Every
computer user unwittingly uses such software on a daily basis, and
companies such as Google and Facebook could not exist without Free
Software.</p>
<p>What unethical nature was Stallman disgusted with? The answer lies in
the GNU Manifesto where Stallman states, I consider that the golden rule
requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who
like it. Software sellers want to divide the users and conquer them,
making each user agree not to share with others. I refuse to break
solidarity with other users in this way.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> It seems to
Stallman he should obey the golden rule. One may guess from the text
Stallman would define the golden rule as a principle of reciprocity.
Thus, if an individual likes a program and would want another to share
it with him he is ethically required to share the program with another
as well. Furthermore, an individual must not restrict those he shares
software with from further sharing the software, or from modifying the
software to suit their needs better. To prevent such sharing and
modification would violate his golden rule.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
<p>It is important to note Stallman does not believe that all things should
be shared alike. He only considers such freedom ethical where there is
no harm done to the person who shares by sharing. Stallman states:
"Owners say that they suffer harm or economic loss when users copy
programs themselves. But the copying has no direct effect on the owner,
and it harms no one.<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> Thus, Stallman believes that
copying a program does not harm the original owner, because the owner
does not loose the use of the program because a copy is made. Such
copies can be made indefinitely. In the same way Stallman defends the
right to modify software: whether you run or change a program I wrote
affects you directly and me only indirectly. Whether you give a copy to
your friend affects you and your friend much more than it affects me. I
shouldnt have the power to tell you not to do these things. No one
should.<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Thus, Stallman has constructed his own ethical
system based on how the golden rule seemed to him.</p>
<p>To explain and understand his movement, Stallman constructed a founding
narrative. The narrative begins in ancient times when copyright as a
concept did not exist. Stallman explains that in those times the roles
of authors, copiers, scribes, and commentators were muddled. Everyone
who participated in written culture freely copied, improved, and
commented on previous works.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> Stallman holds this
copyright-free society up as the exemplar from our historical past for
how one should relate to written work.</p>
<p>Stallman continues his narrative by connecting the experiences of early
computer programmers (his in particular) to the copyright-free society
detailed above. While copyright existed when computing culture began in
the 40's and 50's it was not yet universally applied to computer source
code. Stallman participated in this society when he joined the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971: When I started working at the MIT
Articial Intelligence Lab in 1971, I became part of a software-sharing
community that had existed for many years. Sharing of software was not
limited to our particular community; it is as old as computers, just as
sharing of recipes is as old as cooking. But we did it more than
most.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> Stallman holds his early experiences in the AI
Lab as a second exemplar for the proper orders of society, where
software is freely shared, edited, commented, and ported.</p>
<p>However, Stallman's perfect society eventually fell into disrepair.
Programmers were asked to sign software licenses and non disclosure
agreements when the university purchased new equipment and software. To
Stallman these events had a chaogonic<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> quality: This
meant that the first step in using a computer was to promise not to help
your neighbor. A cooperating community was forbidden. The rule made by
the owners of proprietary software was, 'If you share with your
neighbor, you are a pirate. If you want any changes, beg us to make
them.'<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> Thus, the ideal of community which had obeyed
the golden rule began to unravel. No longer could a programmer freely
help his neighbor, no longer could a programmer freely fix bugs, no
longer could a programmer port software to new platforms. The
programmers were now at the mercy of contracts and legal agreements.</p>
<p>In the depths of this disarray, Stallman experienced a heirophany,
Eliade's term for the sacred manifesting itself. It began with the AI
Lab being gifted a printer from Xerox. However, despite giving them the
printer, Xerox refused to share the code for the
driver.<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> Unfortunately, the driver had bugs in it.
When Stallman offered to fix the bugs if they gave him their code, they
refused. The experience was transformative. Stallman could no longer
accept the status quo of license and non-disclosure agreements. He set
out to change the world, so he could return to an ideal society where
programmers helped their neighbors.<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, according to Stallman's narrative detailed above, Stallman set out
to purge his life of the corrupting influence of proprietary software.
Unfortunately, to rid himself of proprietary software he needed to
create a new ecosystem of Free Software. So he quit his job at MIT and
began working on several Free Software programs. Stallman states: I
realized that I was elected to do the job.<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> Thus, he
began the GNU project to create a Free operating system and ecosystem of
software. Without, such an ecosystem Stallman feels one cannot live an
upright life as a programmer.<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the Free Software movement seeks to establish an alternative
reality where all software written is Free. Users are free to modify and
redistribute software. No one is free to limit another's use of
software. This movement can be understood using Eliade's categories of
sacred vs profane, and archaic society vs modern society.</p>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>The copyright free societies Stallman references in his narrative
parallel the Eliadian concept of the archaic society. In both cases
these societies are held up as exemplars of what it means to be truly
religious, to be a homo religiosus. In Stallman's pre-copyright society,
programmers shared with each other freely, they modified programs
without hesitation; unwittingly they obeyed his golden rule and helped
their neighbors. In modern society programmers no longer share code and
modify programs. They are prevented from doing so. Thus, they no longer
obey the golden rule. By not obeying the golden rule they have become
corrupt.<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Stallman's narrative fits into Eliade's categories of the modern society
vs. the archaic society. Stallman represents himself as a truly
religious person living in the modern society seeking to return to the
archaic society. His method for returning to the archaic society is to
resacralize the world.</p>
<p>To sacralize, one must have a concept of something that is sacred vs.
something that is profane. For to sacralize one make the the profane
sacred. For Stallman, Free Sofware itself is sacred. Free Software is
opposite the profane proprietary software. Proprietary software cannot
be shared and it cannot be modified. Free Software can be explicitly
shared and modified. Free Software also manifests a numinous quality.
Specifically, Free Software is the revelation of the ideal divine
society today. In the ideal society all software is Free Software. To
have Free Software in present society is to experience the revelation of
the ideal. Thus, Free Software is not just sharable and modifiable it
also sacred. Free Software is Sacred Software.</p>
<p>Stallman desires to return to his ideal archaic society where
programmers were more religious and users could share and modify
programs at will. To bring about the return of the archaic society he
must resacralize the present profane society. To do so he created the
GNU Project to manifest Sacred Software into the present profane space.
Thus, Stallman marks off the sacred, Free Software, from the profane,
proprietary software, in an attempt to return humanity to the ideal
society.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Free Software movement can be understood as a religious movement
using Eliade's terms and categories. Stallman basis his movement on his
understanding of the golden rule. He uses his understanding of the rule
to construct an ethical system for the production and use of software.
Stallman then constructs a narrative to explain how society has moved
from a religious ethical past to a profane present. To return society to
the ideal past, Stallman attempts resacralize the present society by
creating Free Software. Free Software is sacred. By introducing Free
Software into present society, society becomes more sacred. The
utilization of Eliade's categories clarified the religious aspects of
the Free Software movement.</p>
